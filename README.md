# TreasureChest
## Description
TreasureChest is a small .NET application that tracks expenditures from a central pool to which anybody could contribute, and
distributes costs based on attendance and consumption.

## History
The idea of this tool came about when my friends and I regularly met for sessions of Dungeons and Dragons,
each bringing some drinks or snacks. To make sure that everybody paid evenly for what they consumed, I made this tool.

It ...
* tracks the amounts contributed to the pool for each person,
* tracks the snacks and drinks bought from the pool,
* tracks who attended when and what was consumed at that time
* distributes the costs fairly and subtracts them from the contributions.

You can easily see when a person's contribution is depleted.

## Status
Because we don't often come together to play, this tool has seen no update in years.

Nonetheless, the tool works and is quite stable. Feel free to use it as you wish.
